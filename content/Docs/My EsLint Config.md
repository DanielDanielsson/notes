> [!tip]
> If you edit Quartz configuration using a text-editor that has TypeScript language support like VSCode, it will warn you when you you've made an error in your configuration, helping you avoid configuration mistakes!

> [!hint] Flags and options
> For full help options, you can run `npx quartz build --help`.

> [!warning]- `fatal: --[no-]autostash option is only valid with --rebase`
> You may have an outdated version of `git`. Updating `git` should fix this issue.
